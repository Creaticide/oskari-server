# Upgrading

Database upgrade scripts are located under: content-resources/src/main/resources/sql/upgrade/{version}

Additional upgrade instuctions are located under: docs/upgrade/{version}.md

Upgrade scripts can also update content on the database so use caution and check them before running. You can also ask if you dont know how it will affect your system.

Release notes on oskari-server root are also worth checking out and if anything is broken, please tell us so we can fix it/add documentation.
