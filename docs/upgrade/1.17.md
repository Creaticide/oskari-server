# Upgrade for maplayers refactoring

1) Run SQLs in oskari-server\content-resources\src\main\resources\sql\upgrade\1.17\oskari_maplayer.sql

2) Go to "oskari-server\content-resources\db-upgrade"

3) Modify config.js to match your database settings (see template file config.js.example)

4) Run "SCRIPT=oskari_maplayers_migration node app.js"

5) Things to check for successful migration:
* Each maplayer in portti_maplayer should now be found in oskari_maplayer
* oskari_maplayer should now also contain base/grouplayers that were previously found in portti_layerclass
* oskari_layergroup should now contain all organizations from portti_layerclass, but NOT base/grouplayers from portti_layerclass
* inspirethemes are now linked for maplayer via a linking table oskari_maplayer_themes (layers can belong to multiple themes on db level - not fully implemented throughout the system)
