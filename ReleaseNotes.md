# Release Notes

## 1.20

### service-users

A new module has been added for user management. Oskari now has database tables for users and roles and a new UserService
implementation utilizing them (DatabaseUserService). The DatabaseUserService is now configured as default in oskari.properties
 but can be overridden by oskari-ext.properties.

### servlet-map/webapp-map/JAAS authentication

Servlet for map application has been separated into servlet code and webapp with JSPs and webapp configuration (webapp-map).
Building the webapp-map is essentially the same as building servlet-map before this. The user login handling has been taken
out of the servlet implementation and a reference JAAS configuration is now available in webapp-map. A servletfilter is now
available in servlet-map to handle login using JAAS. The login form field names have changes to reflect this.

Servlet aggregate pom.xml (servlet-map-pom.xml) has been removed since the parent pom now builds the servlet, webapp and standalone
so you can use mvn clean install on the oskari-server root to build the modules.

### standalone-jetty

The separation of servlet-map to wepapp/servlet allows for new packaging "standalone-jetty" that uses preconfigured embedded
jetty to serve basic oskari-map functionality without the need to install any server software. Some default values for properties
containing URLs have been changed in oskari.properties to make the configuration easier and some new properties describing the
run environment has been added to configure the running environment (domain/path to map application).

### content-resources

The database used should now have postgis extension enabled to successfully run the whole default setup!
The default setup will now do a whole lot more (creates also myplaces, users and JAAS tables etc).
Lots of setup files have been merged and renamed since some have become irrelevant.
Many SQL-files have been renamed and some have been separated into smaller pieces.

Property keys in db.properties have been changed to use the same ones as utilized by other properties:

* datasource -> db.jndi.name
* url -> db.url
* user -> db.username
* pass -> db.password

Also oskari.properties and oskari-ext.properties now override db.properties so each component can be configured to use the same
credentials/urls with single properties file.

## 1.19

### control-base/Myplaces2Handler

Now validates WFS-T from frontend a bit more thorougly. Also lets Guest users to insert features to a myplaces layer which is marked as "draw layer" ie. is published as public drawable layer.


### External libs

External libs are now handled as an in-project repository. The location of libs is defined in oskari-server/pom.xml as a repository.
The files can still be installed into local repository as before but it's not mandatory.

### WMTS layer support

No longer formats style/styles array with hard coded "default". Instead uses oskari_maplayer tables style to create the JSON values.

### Documentation

Docs has been removed from oskari-server repository and they are now available in http://www.oskari.org/documentation and https://github.com/nls-oskari/oskari.org/tree/master/md/documentation along with frontend documentation

### geoserver-ext/OskariMarkFactory (also affects transport WFS custom style)

Fixed resource leaking when loading font. Tmp-files were being created recklessly, now caches the font after loading it.

Also enabled the use of another font in classpath, previously font was hardcoded into dot-markers. Now the font specified in SLD is used with a fallback to dot-markers if specified font can't be loaded.

### service-search

SearchCriteria no longer has reference to MetadataCatalogueSearchCriteria. SearchCriteria.addParam() can be used to provide search channel additional criterias.

SearchResultItem now has addValue() that can be used to provide calling component additional search result values.

### service-base/Caching

CacheManager is now available and can be used to provide simple in-memory caches. This will most likely be developed further to allow configurable custom cache implementations that can be used to wrap functionality used by caching libraries (similar to UserService and Logger).

### servlet-map

Jetty-maven-plugin is no longer started automatically on install step. To start jetty on install you can use profile jetty-profile:

mvn clean install -Pjetty-profile

### content-resources/DBHandler

Setup-files can now refer to another setup-file. This removes much boilerplate for registering bundles and should make the files simpler.

Myplaces trigger has been updated to do initial update timestamp on insert as well (thanks posiki).

### Analysis functionality

CreateAnalysisLayer action route now returns a proper analysislayer json (same as GetAnalysisLayersHandler)

JSON for analysislayer is now created based on Analysis object with the help of AnalysisHelper. This will propably be refactored in the future to use the LayerJSONFormatter and the misleading AnalysisLayer class will propably be removed in favor of the Analysis class.

AnalysisDataService refactored a bit and to 

### control-base/PublishHandler

Now handles publish permissions correctly (previously checked layer id for 'base_' prefix and used deprecated portti_layerclass db table).

Now allows selected roles to publish maps with drawtools. Roles allowed to publish draw tools is configured with property "actionhandler.Publish.drawToolsRoles".

### service-map/MyPlacesService

Now has a method for creating myplaces layer as wmslayer (used in published maps)

Now has a method for checking permissions based on category id/place id

### control-base/MapfullHandler

MapfullHandler now uses the MyPlacesService for creating json for myplaces layer.

Now handles layers with non-numeric ids correctly (same fix as with PublishHandler and 'base_' prefix on layer name)

## 1.18.1

### control-base/PublishHandler

Now uses template view as basis for existing maps as well. Merges plugin configs sent by client with existing bundle configs. Overrides user configs with template configs on merge so client can't change terms of use URLs etc. Note! Publish template plugins shouldn't have any configurations that can be overridden by user.

### service-map/GetGtWMSCapabilities

Geotools ScaleDenominatorMin is now set to OskariLayer as max scale and vice versa since this is how Oskari components expect to have these values.

## 1.18

### General

Most maven modules under oskari-server now share the maven parent defined in oskari-server/pom.xml. Properties are injected at
compile time and a custom build profile for tomcat has been added (mvn -f servlet-map-pom.xml install -P tomcat-profile).
See [docs/Customizing property values](docs/CustomizingPropertyValues.md) how to customize build for your own properties.

Updated GeoTools version 10.2. The version is now the same all over Oskari modules (previously 2.7.5 and 9.1).

Updated GeoTools can't parse empty Abstract-tags for WFSLayer SLDs. Script to update any existing SLDs in
database (portti_wfs_layer_style table) can be run with the command SCRIPT=remove-empty-abstract-from-SLD node app.js in content-resources/db-upgrade
(check the config.js first for database settings).

Removed some hardcodings: 
* fi.nls.oskari.control.view.modifier.bundle.MapfullHandler

Previously hardcoded myplaces layer wmsurl: "/karttatiili/myplaces?myCat=" 
can now be configured with property 'myplaces.client.wmsurl'

* fi.nls.oskari.control.view.GetAppSetupHandler

Previously hardcoded prefix for secure urls (prefix to make easier proxy forwards) "/paikkatietoikkuna"
can now be configured with property 'actionhandler.GetAppSetup.secureAjaxUrlPrefix'

### Service-map/Layer JSON formatting

LayerJSONFormatterWMS now checks if the layer already has a legend image url configured (by admin) instead of always overwriting it based on capabilities.

### Service-OGC and control-wfs

Have been deprecated. The required parts have been moved to service-map and the currently recommended backend component for WFS-functionality is the transport-servlet.

The deprecated modules can still be found inside oskari-server/deprecated folder.

### Transport

Added override properties handling. Tries to search for file 'transport-ext.properties' in classpath and if found, overrides default values loaded from config.properties if 

### GetAppSetup/ParamHandlers

It's now possible to add preprocessors for ParamHandlers used in GetAppSetup. Check [service-control/README.md](service-control/README.md) for more
info about preprocessing parameters.

## PublishHandler/SaveViewHandler/View and bundle handling

Refactored actionhandlers a bit for cleaner implementation for saving views.
Views and Bundles can now be copied with clone() method.
In the process also ViewService includes methods addView(View) and updatePublishedMap(View) and the old versions with second parameters have been deprecated.

## service-permission/UserService

Moved to service-base so it can be used by Role-class to load information about admin role.

The Platform-specific map parameter has been changed from Map<String, Object> to Map<Object, Object> and a convenience method has been added to main UserService to call getRoles without
parameters.

## service-base/Role

Now has a method getAdminRole() which returns a role reference. Replaces the getAdminRoleName() which has been deprecated.
Now uses UserService to load information about admin role, but still gets the admin role name from properties as before.

## 1.17.2

### GetFeatureInfoHandler

Styles will now longer be sent with value "null", but an empty string

### Transport

MapClick will now send an empty list as response when done so client knows that any data gotten for WMSlayers can be shown.

Default highlight style for lines now doesn't use "fill" and areas  50%

## 1.17.1

### ZoomParamHandler

Now uses parameter correctly again (not trying to get a property with param value).

## 1.17

### service-permission

Added getGuestUser() method for UserService. Implementations should override it and return a Guest user with a Guest role so permission mappings can be done correctly.

### service-map

Added ibatis caching for Inspire-themes, views, wfs-layers and backendstatus operations.

### servlet-map

Added oskariui style classes to index.jsp to fix layout. 

Removed Guest user role hardcoding and now uses UserService.getGuestUser() to create a guest user.

### Massive maplayer refactoring

Maplayer DB structure and JSON formatting has been simplified so all layers are now located in oskari_maplayer database table and all JSON formatting should be done with
fi.mml.map.mapwindow.util.OskariLayerWorker instead of former MapLayerWorker. All layers should now be referenced with OskariLayer instead of (Map-)Layer classes and
they should be loaded using OskariLayerService instead of MapLayerService. Additional upgrade is required - [instructions can be found here](docs/upgrade/1.17.md).

### ParamHandler/ViewModifier/ModifierParams

ParamHandlers now have access to the ActionParams instance for the request. This means they can determine how to handle a parameter depending on other parameters.

## 1.16

### content-resources

Added upgrade SQLs that can be run to update database structure on version update. See [Upgrade documentation for details](docs/Upgrading.md)

Added a new commandline parameter "-Doskari.addview={file under resources/json/views}" to add a view without setup file

Added setupfiles:
* to initialize an empty base db with -Doskari.setup=create-empty-db
* to register bundles with -Doskari.setup=postgres-register-bundles

These can be used to initialize the database step-by-step. Also added an example setup for parcel application (-Doskari.setup=postgres-parcel).


### service-base / IOHelper

Added debugging methods to ignore SSL certificate errors. This can be used for existing code by adding properties (NOTE! This is global setting for all connections through IOHelper):

	oskari.trustAllCerts=true
	oskari.trustAllHosts=true

Individual connections can use these by calling IOHelper-methods:

    public static void trustAllCerts(final HttpURLConnection connection) throws IOException
    public static void trustAllHosts(final HttpURLConnection connection) throws IOException

### servlet-map

Now reads an oskari-ext.properties file from classpath to override default oskari.properties values.

### control-base GetSotkaData

Action handler has been refactored and indicators/regions listing now uses Redis for caching if available

## 1.15

### User domain object

Now has a convenience method to check if user has any of the roles in given String array (containing rolenames)

### GetWSCapabilities action route

Permitted roles for executing the action is now configurable with property 'actionhandler.GetWSCapabilitiesHandler.roles'
