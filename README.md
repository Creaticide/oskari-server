# NOTE!

http://repo.opengeo.org/ has moved to http://repo.boundlessgeo.com/main/ which means that code in master branch doesn't currently compile. A new Oskari release is going live next week (6.10.-12.10) which will include the updated maven repository URLs.

If you need to use the master branch version before that, please update the repository references in pom.xml manually.
